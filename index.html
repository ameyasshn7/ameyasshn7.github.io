            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a PhD student at Oregon State University, advised by
                <a href="https://cropandsoil.oregonstate.edu/users/jing-zhou" target="_blank">Dr. Jing Zhou</a>,
                where my research centers on advancing Computer Vision (CV) and edge computing for agricultural applications.
              </p>
            
              <h3>Research Focus</h3>
              <p>
                My primary research lies at the intersection of computer vision and precision agriculture. I am currently developing systems that automate the detection of off-type seeds—a task traditionally dependent on intensive human labor. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models, my work aims to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of seed sorting. To make these solutions accessible and scalable, I utilize affordable edge computing platforms such as Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson boards as user interfaces and on-site processing units.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to seed detection, I am exploring robust, off-grid systems capable of running computer vision algorithms in remote agricultural environments where connectivity is limited. This approach enables real-time data processing and decision-making directly on the farm, which is critical for timely interventions in crop management and resource optimization.
              </p>
            
              <h3>Broader Interests</h3>
              <p>
                Beyond my core research, I am deeply interested in algorithms and theoretical computer science. I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in these areas, recognizing their foundational role in advancing AI and CV technologies.
              </p>
            
              <h3>Outside the Lab</h3>
              <p>
                When I am not immersed in research, I enjoy making music and spending time outdoors. My music spans various genres—often experimental and always focused on having fun. If you’re curious, you can listen to my work on my
